## Introduction

This package includes functions to calculate the standard status metrics originally defined by Holt et al. 2009, and further refined in subsequent test cases and additional explorations. The package also includes functions for using the resulting metrics in a status assessment (apply rapid status decision tree, generate dashboards).

## Background

### WSP Status Metrics

The WSP metrics are designed to capture different considerations related to *status*, and have been used *in combination* to develop *integrated status designations*. Below is a brief overview with general definitions. For more detail about these metrics, alternative calculation approaches, and their use in formal status asessments, see the [References](#References). 


**Metric** | **General Definition** | **Variations** | **Function** 
-- | -- | -- | --
Long-Term Trend | Recent Avg / Long-term Avg |  geometric mean vs. arithmetic mean |  *calcLongTermTrendSimple()* for a single vector. *calcLongTermTrend()* for a data frame with Years x Stocks (includes retrospective calculations).
Percent Change  | change over n generations | alternative smoothing (log, gen avg), time window (n gen, n gen +1) | *calcPercChangeSimple()* for a single vector of raw values. *calcPercChange()* for a data frame with Years x Stocks (includes retrospective calculations).
Probability of Decline | Prob(PercChange> X%) | alternative smoothing (log, gen avg), time window (n gen, n gen +1) |   *calcPercChangeSimple()* for regression based calculation in a single vector. *calcPercChange()* for a data frame with Years x Stocks (includes retrospective calculations). *calcPercChangeMCMC()* for a Bayesian probability (based on posterior distribution of regression slopes) calculated on a single vector of raw values.
Relative Abundance - SR-Based BM| Recent Avg compared to biological benchmarks (Sgen, 80%Smsy) | geometric mean vs. arithmetic mean, alternative benchmark estimate approaches | first step will be to integrate a subroutine *calcRickerSgen* that converts Ricker parameters to benchmark estimates. For long-term, consider building a larger module *calcRelAbdBM()* that does the model fitting as well.
Relative Abd - Percentile BM| Recent Avg compared to user-specified %iles | geometric mean vs. arithmetic mean | *calcPercentileSimple()* for a single vector. NOTE: This function only calculates the percentile value. It is the *calcMetrics()* wrapper function that compares this value to user-specified benchmarks and assigns a status category. [Holt et al. (2018)](https://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/csas-sccs/Publications/ResDocs-DocRech/2018/2018_011-eng.html) recommend lower and upper percentile-based status benchmarks at the 25th and 50th percentiles of observed spawner abundances for data-limited conservation units of Chum Salmon when productivity is moderate to high (>2.5 recruits/spawner) and harvest rates are low to moderate (≤40%).  [Holt et al. (2018)](https://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/csas-sccs/Publications/ResDocs-DocRech/2018/2018_011-eng.html) suggest further evaluation of percentile benchmarks and the consideration of alternatives when productivity is expected to be low and/or harvest rates high. The function *calcMetrics()* uses 0.25 and 0.50 as the default benchmarks for the percentiles.

### Illustration of Overall Wrapper Function for Metrics

The *calcMetrics()* function takes a time series and applies the individual metric calculations, with user-specified settings, to calculate a full suite of outputs (including retrospective calculation of metrics)


**IMPORTANT NOTE**: Relative and absolute abundance values calculated in *calcMetrics()* use the user-specified settings to choose the method of calculating, and the settings for *avg.specs* and *slope.specs* interact. If the *rel.avg.type* is “regular” instead of “smoothed” it just uses the smoothed series. The smoothing function depends on the whether or not log transforming is used for the slope (```slope.specs$log.transform=TRUE```), otherwise it just takes the average of the generation instead of the geometric average. The typical use case for our applications so far has always had ```slope.specs$log.transform=TRUE```, so there hasn’t been an issue where the wrong type of average is being calculated, but the function was set up for maximum flexibility, so end-users need to keep this interaction in mind.

The function help file has additional details for the arguments. To access the function help file, use

```
?calcMetrics
```

Here is an example of running the calcMetrics() function:


```


head(exampleData)

yrs.vec <- 1:length(exampleData$Stock1) + 1979 # if your data doesn't have yrs, need to generate a yr vector

plot(yrs.vec, exampleData$Stock1,type="o")



test.out <- calcMetrics (  series.in = exampleData$Stock1 , # vector of values
                          yrs.in  = yrs.vec,
                          gen.in = 4, # avg generation time
                          stk.label = "Stock 1", # used for labeling output
                          species.label = "Species", # used for labeling output
                          series.label = "DataVersion", # used for labeling output
                          slope.specs = list(num.gen = 3, extra.yrs = 0,filter.sides=1, slope.smooth=TRUE,
                                             log.transform = TRUE, out.exp = TRUE,na.rm=FALSE),
                          avg.specs = list(avg.type = "geomean",recent.excl=FALSE,
                                           lt.smooth=TRUE, rel.avg.type="regular",
                                           min.lt.yrs =20,min.perc.yrs =20),
                          metric.bm =  list(RelAbd = c(30,50),   # set these at arbitrary numbers for the illustration
                                            AbsAbd = c(1000,10000),
                                            LongTrend = c(0.5,0.75),
                                            PercChange = c(-25,-15),
                                            ProbDeclBelowLBM = c(NA,NA),
                                            Percentile = c(0.25,0.5)),
                          retro.start = NULL,
                          tracing = TRUE)



head(test.out)

### Illustration of Rapid Status Decision Tree Functions

The functions are:

* *applyRapidStatus()*: function that applies the rapid status decision tree to a data set of WSP metrics generated with *calcMetrics()*
* **add plotting functions once they are included**

[This repository](https://github.com/SOLV-Code/WSP-Rapid-Status-WorkedExamples) has
worked examples of the full workflow from metric calculations to status dashboards, using all the functions from this package.
